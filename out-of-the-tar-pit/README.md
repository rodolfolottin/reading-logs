* Simplicity is the way,
* Often software complexity is confused with computer (algorithmic) complexity. You can have a simple software (with a low level of complexity) but in the other term it can have a higher level of complexity,
* The major contributor of software complexity is the handling of state and flow of control (which can be the same),
* Complexity, Conformity, Changeability and Invisibility,
* Simplicity is hard,
* Improvements in informal reasoning will lead to less errors being created, while improvements in testing will lead to more errors being detected,
* Improvements in informal reasoning will facilitate all future attempts to understand the system,
