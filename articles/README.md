### [Opportunistic Refactoring - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OpportunisticRefactoring.html<Paste>)

* Always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it,
* Refactor before start adding new functionalities,
* A codebase with written tests is much better to refactor than the opposite,
* If you don't spend time refactoring your code it slowly (or not) starts to gradually degrade,
* The decision requires thoughtfulness,
* It's important to pay attention to anything that is discouraging people from doing it,
* "Team that's using refactoring well should hardly ever need to plan refactoring, instead seeing refactoring as a constant stream of small adjustments"
