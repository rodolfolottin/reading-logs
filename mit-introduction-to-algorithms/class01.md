## 1. [Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)

    A class about algorithmical thinking. It starts with a briefly explanation about the course content and then jumps right into the peak finding topic.

    The video lecture covers optimal (binary, the famous divide and conquer approach) search in one dimensional and two dimensional vectors. Explaining why it is faster and its complexity for the worst case. For both 1d and 2d vectors, the algorithm starts by accessing the middle of the structure and checking if it is a peak, if not it reasons if the left or the right element is the next one it must reason about. For the 2d vector it starts in the `(m / 2)` column , finds its max (`i`), then it uses the same approach for the 1d vector.
