The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

`Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way.`

The Clean Code shows why it’s important to write good code, not only code that works, and also how the bad code starts to “appear” in the code base because of small decisions taken during a work day. These decisions maybe are based on the lack of time, you’re trying to make a task faster, but in the long run, the poor code added will definitely slow the development down.
Some advices shared in the book involves things that seems to be pretty obvious, but tend to be easily forgettable, like: Give good names to your variables/functions, use constants instead of magical number, write small functions, and don’t repeat yourself. Another interest think in the book is the concept that source code should be readable as a book.
The last part of the book is not that fascinating, due to the fact that all refactoring examples are in Java; so the majority of the concepts cannot be reproduced in other programming languages such as Python or JavaScript.

Recommendation: Every programmer desiring to improve his ability to write beautiful, readable and clean code, not code that only works.
