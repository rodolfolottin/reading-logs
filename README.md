# reading-logs

The purpose of this repository is, of course, to serve as a log of the technical books, papers, blog posts, videos and talks that I've considered important to take notes. Also, I want to practice my writing skills.

Notes to myself:

* This is a draft, don't worry about it,
* Do not forget to upload the pdf with the highlights or the video link.

Good places to find papers:

* [github.com/papers-we-love](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love)
