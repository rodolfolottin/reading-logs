# reading-logs

The purpose of this repository is, of course, to serve as a log of the technical books, papers and blog posts that I've considered important to take notes. Also, I want to practice my writing skills.

Notes to myself:

* This is a draft, don't worry about it,
* Do not forget to upload the pdf file with the highligts when finishing the paper,
